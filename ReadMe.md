# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Overview
This is a Java-based CPU scheduling simulator implementing the following algorithms:
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling
- FCAI Scheduling (Custom)

## Features
- Calculates waiting time, turnaround time, and averages.
- Supports context switching and preemption.
- Displays execution order of processes.

## How to Run
1. Compile the project:
2. Run the program:


## Inputs
- Number of processes.
- Process details: Name, arrival time, burst time, priority.
- Time quantum for Round Robin.
- Context switching time.

## Outputs
- Execution order of processes.
- Waiting time, turnaround time, and averages.
- BONUS: Gantt GUI visualization.
